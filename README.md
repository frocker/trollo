# Laka Technical Test - Felix's Submission

## Todo Component
- Pretty basic, supports delete, toggle and edit methods.
- Added a few flexbox rules to line everything up nicely, but didn't really get into styling.

## CheckAllComplete Method
- Assumes complete, and breaks on finding first incomplete
- More efficent in terms of code & computation 

- Added perisistance, used simple local storage for this task
- Automatically saves and loads using `ComponentWillUpdate` and `ComponentOnMount` as triggers.
