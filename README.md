# Welcome to the Laka Technical Test!

Trollo is an application designed to function as a TODO list for forgetful developers. It is a server rendered React application using [Zeit's next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) framework.

The test is designed to assess frontend skills and shouldn't take you more than two hours to complete. 

* The `components/Todo.js` component has gone missing! You will need to implement it from scratch
* Think about how the code could be optimised in components/Board.js, particularly the `checkAllComplete` function.
* Currently if you refresh the page, all your todo lists are gone forever! How could the state be saved?
* And finally, this is a great opportunity to show off your skills - feel free to chop and change the styling and flow of the app!
